It has been a university since 1966, but it dates back to 1909, when Loughborough Technical Institute began with a focus on skills directly applicable in the wider world. In March 2013, the university announced it had bought the former broadcast centre at the [[Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park]] as a second campus. The annual income of the institution for 2022&ndash;23 was £369.1&nbsp;million, of which £48.3&nbsp;million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of £339.1&nbsp;million.<ref name="Loughborough Financial Statement 22/23"/>

== History ==
The university traces its roots back to 1909, when the Loughborough Technical Institute was founded in the town centre. There followed a period of rapid expansion led by principal [[Herbert Schofield]], during which there was renaming to Loughborough College and development of the present campus.

In early years, efforts were made to mimic the environment of an [[Oxbridge]] college, e.g. students wore gowns to lectures, while maintaining a strong practical counterbalance to academic learning. During World War I, it served as an "instructional factory", training workers for the munitions industry.<ref name="40years">[https://www.lboro.ac.uk/anniversary/pages/history.html Loughborough University 40th Anniversary Pages] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212040109/https://www.lboro.ac.uk/anniversary/pages/history.html |date=12 February 2009}} History.</ref>
[[File:Lufbra HazleriggBuilding.jpg|thumb|right|The Hazlerigg Building on campus]]

=== The Loughborough colleges ===
Following the war, the institute divided into four separate colleges:
*Loughborough Training College (teacher training)
*Loughborough College of Art (art and design)
*[[Loughborough College|Loughborough College of Further Education]] (technical and vocational)
*Loughborough College of Technology (technology and science)

The last would become the nucleus of the present university. Its rapid expansion from a small provincial college to the first British technical university was due largely to its principals, [[Herbert Schofield]], who led it from 1915 to 1950, and [[Herbert Haslegrave]], who oversaw its further expansion from 1953 to 1967 and steered its progress first to a College of Advanced Technology and then to a university in 1966.<ref name=Heroes>[http://www.175heroes.org.uk/herbert_haslegrave.html 175 Heroes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103125200/http://www.175heroes.org.uk/herbert_haslegrave.html |date=3 November 2012 }} Herbert Haslegrave.</ref> In 1977, the university broadened its range of studies by amalgamating with Loughborough College of Education (formerly the Training College). More recently, in August 1998, the university merged with Loughborough College of Art and Design (LCAD). [[Loughborough College]] remains a college of further education.

=== Influence of Herbert Schofield ===
[[Herbert Schofield]] became [[Principal (university)|principal]] in 1915, and continued to lead the College of Technology until 1950. Under his guidance, the college changed almost beyond recognition. He bought the estate of [[Burleigh Hall]] on the western outskirts of the town, which became the nucleus of the present {{Convert|438|acres|km2|adj=on}} campus. He oversaw the building of the original Hazlerigg and Rutland halls of residence, which are now home to the university's administration and the vice-chancellor's offices.

=== From college to university ===
An experienced educationist, Herbert Haslegrave took over as college principal in 1953. By increasing breadth and raising standards, he gained the institution the status of [[College of Advanced Technology (United Kingdom)|Colleges of Advanced Technology]] in 1958. He persuaded the Department of Education to buy further land and began a building programme.<ref name=Heroes/>

In 1963, the [[Robbins Report]] on higher education recommended that all colleges of advanced technology be given university status. Loughborough College of Technology was granted a [[Royal Charter]] on 19 April 1966, and became Loughborough University of Technology (LUT), with Haslegrave as its first vice-chancellor.<ref name="40years"/> It gradually remodelled itself in the image of the [[plate glass university|plate glass universities]] of the period, which had also been created under Robbins.

=== Later history ===
In 1977, Loughborough Training College (now Loughborough College of Education) was absorbed into the university. In 1996, the university dropped the "of Technology" from its title, becoming plain Loughborough University.<ref name="40years"/> The Arts College was also amalgamated with the university in 1998. These additions have diluted the technological flavour of the institution, causing it to resemble more a traditional university with its mix of humanities, arts and sciences. 

The shortened name "Lboro", "Lufbra" or "Luff" is commonly used by the students' union,<ref name=lufbranet>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lufbra.net/ |title=Loughborough Students' Union |access-date=16 July 2015 |archive-date=9 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130809061332/http://www.lufbra.net/ |url-status=live}}</ref> the alumni association<ref name=alumni>{{Cite web |url=http://alumni.lboro.ac.uk/ |title=Loughborough Alumni |access-date=16 July 2015 |archive-date=17 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717194420/http://alumni.lboro.ac.uk/ |url-status=live}}</ref> and others.

== Campus ==
[[File:Loughborough University Entrance.jpg|thumb|right|The Bastard Gates (1932)]]
[[File:Lufbra_Walled_Garden_2021.jpg|thumb|right|The Walled Garden in summer 2021]]
The university's main campus is in the town of Loughborough. That campus (once the estate of Burleigh Hall) covers an area of 523 acres,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Loughborough campus {{!}} About the University {{!}} Loughborough University |url=https://www.lboro.ac.uk/about/loughborough-campus/ |access-date=2023-07-10 |website=www.lboro.ac.uk}}</ref> and includes academic departments, 17 halls of residence, the Students' Union, two gyms, gardens and playing fields.

Of particular interest are The Walled Garden, with its Garden of Remembrance, the Hazlerigg-Rutland Hall fountain-courtyard, the old cottage, and the Bastard Gates donated by and named after William Bastard, the Chairman of College Governors, which form the official entrance to Rutland Hall.

In the central quadrangle of the campus stands a famous [[Lebanon Cedar|cedar]], which has often appeared as a symbol for the university. A heavy snowfall in December 1990 led to the collapse of the upper canopy which gave the tree its distinctive shape.

=== Library ===
[[File:PilkingtonEntrance.jpg|thumb|right|Pilkington Library]]
The [[Pilkington Library]] opened in 1980. It covers 9,161 square metres over four floors with 1375 study places – up from 780 prior to the renovation in late 2013. The library has a history of undertaking research in the field of library and information work. There is an open access area, where students are allowed to take in cold food and drinks as well as to engage in group discussions.

=== Traditions ===
The official colour of the university is [[African violet (color)|African violet]]. The [[coat of arms]] incorporates several symbols relevant to the history of the Loughborough area, including [[Offa of Mercia]]'s cross (a symbol of the ancient kingdom of [[Mercia]], within whose borders the town now stands) and the [[peafowl]] from the arms of the [[Duke of Rutland|Dukes of Rutland]]. The motto of the university is ''veritate scientia labore'' ("with truth, wisdom and labour", or, alternatively, "with truth, knowledge and work", depending on the translation).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Personal Best {{!}} Personal Best {{!}} Loughborough University |url=https://www.lboro.ac.uk/students/personal-best/ |access-date=2021-02-05 |website=www.lboro.ac.uk |archive-date=17 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210417045524/https://www.lboro.ac.uk/students/personal-best/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

The university has a strong tradition in both engineering and sport. From its strong engineering and technical background it has now expanded, becoming a centre of excellence in the field of sports and [[sports science]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} It has graduated a number of world-class athletes including [[Paula Radcliffe]] and [[Sebastian Coe|Lord Coe]]. In keeping with this tradition, Loughborough students have won the British Universities & Colleges Sport Association (BUCS) championship every year for four decades. The university is the home of the England and Wales Cricket Board's [[ECB National Academy|National Academy]], opened in November 2003.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}

The phonetic spelling "Lufbra" is sometimes used amongst students, graduates, and in Students' Union publications, and the name is also often abbreviated to "lboro", both casually and within more formal/academic circles, stemmed from the university's [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] of "[https://www.lboro.ac.uk www.lboro.ac.uk]".

There is a one-week break between semester one and semester two. Normally few to no exams are scheduled in this week therefore students are presented with a week free from studies. This week is referred to as Refreshers Week by most students.

The university (and Loughborough College before it) once had a "mascot" consisting of an oversized [[knight]]'s helmet with a lowered visor, commonly called "Thor". This was constructed in 1958 by students of Hazlerigg-Rutland hall in the college welding shop.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://lborouniversity.tumblr.com/post/110888569798/fortunately-uniofnottingham-we-replaced-our-old/amp |title=Loughborough University — Fortunately uniofnottingham we replaced our old}}</ref> In the late 1980s Thor was displayed in the Students' Union foyer, but it has since gone missing.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.lboro.ac.uk/alumni/news/2017/loughborough-university-mascot-thor-returns.html |title=2017 &#124; Loughborough University mascot, Thor, returns &#124; Loughborough Alumni &#124; Loughborough University |access-date=9 October 2020 |archive-date=1 December 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201201123324/https://www.lboro.ac.uk/alumni/news/2017/loughborough-university-mascot-thor-returns.html |url-status=live}}</ref> There is much speculation concerning its current whereabouts.

== Academic profile ==
The university has 20 academic departments and over 100 research groups, institutes and centres currently divided between nine schools. Previously the departments and research institutes had been split between three faculties: Science, Engineering and Social Science & Humanities.

It has {{HESA student population|INSTID=0152}} students; {{HESA undergraduate population|INSTID=0152}} of whom are undergraduates and {{HESA postgraduate population|INSTID=0152}} are pursuing postgraduate courses and/or research (based on {{HESA year}} figures).<ref name="HESA citation">{{HESA citation}}</ref> Its current [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] is Lord [[Sebastian Coe]], (the previous chancellor, Sir [[Nigel Rudd]] retired from the position in summer 2015, having served for five years).

Loughborough University's vice-chancellor and president is Professor [[Nick Jennings (computer scientist)|Nick Jennings]] [[Order of the Bath|CB]], FREng, FRS, who took up the post in October 2021 following the departure of [[Robert Allison (professor)|Robert Allison]], who left the post at the end of the 2020/21 academic year.

The university has won seven [[Queen's Anniversary Prize]]s for Higher and Further Education for work with the aeronautical and automotive industries (1994); support for developing countries (1998); for a pioneering role in developing applications of modern optics and laser technologies (2000); for its world leading roles in sports research, education and development (2002); for its world leading role in social policy in recognition of its outstanding and widely respected work in evaluating and helping develop social policy-related programmes, such as those for cared for children, social security policy, crime prevention, education initiatives and young carers (2005); for recognition of its vehicle, road and driver safety research (2007); and for its impact through research and skills development in High Value Manufacturing to create economic growth (2013).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.lboro.ac.uk/about/qap.html |title=Queen's Anniversary Prize |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707053000/https://www.lboro.ac.uk/about/qap.html |archive-date=7 July 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>
